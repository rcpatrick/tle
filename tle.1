.TH TLE 1
.SH NAME
tle \- NORAD two-line element set processor
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B tle COMMAND [ARGUMENT]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B tle
is a tool for handling NORAD two-line element sets (TLEs). It can retrieve
the TLE for any satellite specified by NORAD SATNO or international designator. It can also print human-readable elements and compute the epoch time and age of any TLE.
.SH COMMANDS
.TP
.B sat [ID]
Return the TLE of the satellite specified by ID, which can be a SATNO (5-digit NORAD catalog ID #, e.g. 25544 for the International Space Station)
or INTDES (International Designator of the form YYNNNA... e.g. 98067A for the ISS).
.TP
.B decode [ID]
Print a more human-readable list of orbital elements.
.TP
.B epochtime [ID]
Print the epoch time of the given TLE in YYYY DDD HH:MM:SS.MMM format.
.TP
.B age [ID]
Print the age of the TLE (time elapsed since epoch.)
.TP
.B places [PLACE | edit]
If PLACE is a place code found in share/places.csv, print information about the
place. If the argument 'edit' is passed, opens places.csv in $EDITOR.
.TP
.B cron
Set up and manage cron jobs for automatically downloading new TLE files.
(Coming soon)
.TP
.B looks [ID]
Calculate look angles for a specific satellite. (Coming soon)
.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
.B tle sat 25544
Will print the two-line element set for the International Space Station to stdout.
.TP
.B tle decode 25544
Will print a human-readable list of the ISS's orbital elements.
.TP
.B tle decode 25544 | grep \(dqInclination\(rs|Period\(dq
Because it is run in the shell, this program is very extensible. You can use your built-in Unix-like utils to filter the output of
.B tle.
This example will print only the inclination and period of the ISS. You could write a wrapper script to accept a SATNO or INTDES and return
only those elements that you care about.
.TP
.B tle places fyl
Will print information about the RAF Fylingdales radar station: one of the pre-set places for computing look angles in share/places.csv.
